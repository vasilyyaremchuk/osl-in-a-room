# Play: In a room
Open-Source Literature: Play: In a room.

## The Outline of this Play

The main idea of this piece of art just create a play with a simple decorations. It could be a room with a man and a woman inside. 

No matter where this room is, the outside world certainly influences what happens in the room, but this influence is just secondary, as well as the influence of the past and the future. We live in the present.

It could be a few stories and a set of dialogs. People in different stories could be different but it might be some connections between different stories, for example, some couples can leave some goods in the room that can appear in the next story and so on.

Everybody could add their own story as well as propose improvment of the existing one.

Please use a new "Chapter-N.md" file for each new story, where N is the incrimental number.

Go ahead!
